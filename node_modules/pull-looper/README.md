# pull-looper

Wrap a pull-stream so that it can be read from with deep recursion without triggering a RangeError.
Uses [looper](https://github.com/dominictarr/looper).

Usage: Just stick the module in a pull-stream pipeline.
Example:

```
var pull = require('pull-stream')
var pullLooper = require('pull-looper')

pull(
  ...,
  pullLooper,
  ...
)
```

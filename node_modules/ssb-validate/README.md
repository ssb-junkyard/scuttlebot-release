# ssb-validate

validate ssb messages, completely functionally.

this module seeks to replace ssb-feed, and contain the logic to validate ssb messages,
but this is implemented functionally, with serializable state.
this means, that the states generated when the reference implementation runs
can be extracted and used as test cases in other implementations.
